                    <p>On April 26, 2025, a vehicle-ramming attack took place at the Lapu-Lapu Day festival, a public celebration of Filipino heritage in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The attack left eleven people dead and at least two dozen more injured, making it the deadliest attack in Vancouver's history. Alongside the 2018 Toronto van attack, it stands as the deadliest vehicle-ramming incident in Canadian history.</p>
<p>According to the Vancouver Police Department, the car attack was not an act of terrorism.</p>
<h3 id="section-background">Background</h3>
<p>Lapu-Lapu Day is a Filipino celebration named for Lapu-Lapu, a Mactan chief who fought against Spanish colonization, and commemorates the victory of the chieftain and his allies against Ferdinand Magellan and his forces at the Battle of Mactan in 1521. British Columbia officially recognized the event in 2023, and an annual festival for Filipino Canadians—who hold a strong presence in Vancouver—has been held in the city since the day was recognized in the province.</p>
<p>According to two Vancouver City Council members, the venue was not cordoned off by city dump trucks as it was in previous city festivals. According to VPD interim chief Steve Rai, police had conducted a security assessment of the festival with the City of Vancouver and festival organizers and determined there were no threats to the event or Filipino community, noting the previous year's festival had "zero issues." The Vancouver Sun Run scheduled for the next morning went ahead with increased police presence after the Vancouver Police Department determined there was no ongoing threat to public safety.</p>
<p>The attack occurred two days before the 2025 Canadian federal election. New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh had attended the festival and left only minutes before the attack.</p>

<p>The car used in the April 26 attack was speeding recklessly in the neighbourhood before turning onto the site of the attack. A minute or two before the attack, the car had made a U-turn and was pulled over to the roadside as if to park.</p>
<p>At approximately 8:14 p.m. PDT (UTC−7), a black Audi Q7 SUV was driven at a high speed through a section of East 43rd Avenue west of Fraser Street. The street had been converted into a food truck zone to serve the Lapu-Lapu Day Block Party, which was held at the adjacent John Oliver Secondary School. Witnesses described bodies sent flying on impact with the car, and videos showed wreckage and victims scattered across a long stretch of road after the attack.</p>
<h3 id="section-victims">Victims</h3>
<p>Eleven people, ranging in age from 5 to 65, were killed and more than 24 others were injured, some critically. As of April 27, some of the victims were not identified. Vancouver General Hospital received several victims and announced a code orange, indicating a mass casualty incident. On the following day, the Ministry of Health confirmed that 32 people (including the 11 dead) had been hospitalized, and that 17 people remained in the hospital at that time.</p>
<p>The deceased victims included 34-year-old Brazilian musician Clara "Kira" Ganapol Salim, one of the founders of the Carnival group Marcha Nerd, and a New Westminster school counsellor.</p>

<p>Following the attack, Mark Carney cancelled election events by the Liberal Party in Calgary and Richmond and went to the site of the attack on April 27 before meeting with relatives of the victims and participating in a church vigil. Poilievre made an unscheduled visit at a church in Mississauga to meet members of the Filipino community. Singh canceled his scheduled appearances on April 27.</p>
<p>The surrounding roads, namely southbound Fraser Street and East 43rd Avenue, where the attack took place, remained closed in the days after.</p>
<h3 id="section-accused">Accused</h3>
<p>The driver, Kai-Ji Adam Lo, a 30-year-old man from Vancouver, was apprehended by bystanders after attempting to flee and taken into custody by police.</p>
<p>He is believed to have acted alone and was the only occupant of the car. The Vancouver Police confirmed that the accused has a significant history of interactions with police and healthcare professionals "related to mental health", but he had no prior criminal record. The police rejected terrorism as a motive in the incident.</p>
<p>On January 28, 2024, Lo's 31-year-old older brother, Alexander, was found dead in their Kensington-Cedar Cottage area home in East Vancouver. A suspect was charged with second-degree murder in connection to the killing, pleading not guilty in October 2024 with trial pending as of April 2025.</p>
<p>Lo organized an online fundraiser to cover costs of his brother's funeral, and received over $9,000 in donations. In August 2024, Lo's mother attempted suicide and was in the hospital for a month. Adam Lo organized another online fundraiser which yielded poor results.</p>
<p>Police had an interaction with Lo on April 25. The only detail about the interaction released by police as of April 27 was that they decided that a hospital visit was not required.</p>
<p>Hours before the attack, a family member had contacted a psychiatric ward about Lo's deteriorating mental health. He appeared to suffer from delusions and paranoia. It is currently unknown whether any action was taken.</p>

<p>Lo was charged with eight counts of second-degree murder under Section 235 of the Criminal Code and made a court appearance for a bail hearing on the afternoon of April 27. Lo will remain in police custody after not requesting bail during the appearance. Lo's next court appearance in the Provincial Court of British Columbia is scheduled for May 26. Vancouver Police indicated that further charges would likely be laid as the investigation continues to identify victims.</p>
<h3 id="section-responses">Responses</h3>
<p>Numerous local and national political figures offered their condolences, including Prime Minister Mark Carney, federal Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, federal New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh (who had attended the festival earlier in the day), Governor General Mary Simon, British Columbia premier David Eby, Vancouver mayor Ken Sim, and federal Green Party co-leader Elizabeth May. Vancouver Police Department interim chief Steve Rai described the attack as "the darkest day in our city's history". King Charles III offered his condolences and said in a statement that he and Queen Camilla were "profoundly saddened" to hear of the attack.</p>
<p>The Philippine Consulate General in Vancouver expressed sympathy.  In the Philippines, President Bongbong Marcos, Vice President Sara Duterte, and several senators expressed sadness and outrage over the attack as well as sympathy for the victims.</p>
<p>Vancouver Whitecaps FC held a moment of silence for the victims of the attack and held a Philippine flag prior to their game against Minnesota United FC on April 26.</p>
